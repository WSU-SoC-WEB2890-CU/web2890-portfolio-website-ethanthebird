      <p>
        Out of all the courses I’ve taken, I think the biggest “reality check” experience I’ve had would be the creation
        of the actual FalconForge website in WEB2620. What started off being another assignment quickly became a
        realisation that I had actually created something (off the top of my head) from scratch and made it functional
        and live on the internet. It was hard, there is no denying that, for being my first fully funcitonal multi-page
        website (even with basic styling), it was awesome! Although it still had its flaws, I was able to see a new
        perspective on the UX Design community as well as a new perspective of what challenges I might see later on down
        the road in life and work experience. By taking that “first” big step and creating something unique like that, I
        was able to get a glimpse of what the future may hold for me and for what my education has been leading me to.
        I’ve still got a lot to learn and practice, but this was definitely a start in the right direction!
